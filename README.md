# What's For Dinner?

This is an app for couples that can't decide where to go eat.

## What was your motivation?

My motivation was to practice javascript programming and work with saving user input data.

## Why did you build this project?

To practice what I know and to try and create a survey based app that helps couples and groups decide what they want to eat.

## How to use

Each person finishes the whole survey until the final data result shows.

Card rank are as follows:

2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack(10), Queen(10), King(10), Ace(1 or 11)

Player can either STAND or HIT. You are also able to determine the betting amount.
